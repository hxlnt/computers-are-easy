Computers Are Easy, Love is Kind (v. 2.0) Rachel Simone Weil/Electronic Love Operation 2015

"Computers Are Easy, Love is Kind" is an NES ROM that demonstrates basic music, sprite animation, user input, and color cycling. The ROM was made in one day, on the occasion of the US Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality (June 26, 2015). Fully-commented 6502 ASM source code and updates to the sparkle animation were released on September 11, 2015.

Playing the ROM: Press up and down to change colors. Press B to toggle glitching. Press A to toggle sparkle animation.

Source code: Hopefully the commented source code is of help to those wishing to know more about how NES games are written. In the FCEUX emulator (Windows only), you can watch variables update by loading the compiled ROM and choosing Debug > Hex editor. Watch values $0000 through $0015. To compile from source, use NESASM3 (not included). NESASM3 usage is nesasm3 loveiskind.asm

Artist statement: What is the video-game equivalent of a love song? In my work, I seek to use obsolete technology in whimsical and romantic ways to bring people closer to one another. And while assembly language programming might seem intimidating to the newcomer, it's important to keep in mind that computers are easy! Love is kind! You can do it!

As this program was written quickly, there likely remain errors or opportunities to make the code even more efficient. Perhaps you can find them. Have fun, traveler!
